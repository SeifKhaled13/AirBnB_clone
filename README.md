# AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project involves building a command interpreter in Python to manage AirBnB objects. The command interpreter allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects used in the AirBnB application. This is the first step towards building a full web application, where you will later integrate HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end components.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the project, it is recommended to read the AirBnB concept page to understand the overall idea and requirements. The command interpreter will utilize several key concepts and technologies to achieve its functionality:

- **BaseModel**: A parent class responsible for object initialization, serialization, and deserialization.
- **Serialization Flow**: A simple flow of converting instances to dictionaries, JSON strings, and files, and vice versa.
- **AirBnB Classes**: Creation of various classes such as User, State, City, Place, etc., all inheriting from the BaseModel class.
- **File Storage**: The first abstracted storage engine in the project, allowing objects to be stored in files.
- **Unit Tests**: Creation of comprehensive unit tests to validate classes and storage engine functionality.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter serves as a shell-like interface to manage AirBnB objects. It enables you to perform the following operations:

- **Create**: Create a new object, such as a User or a Place.
- **Retrieve**: Retrieve an object from a file, a database, or any other storage medium.
- **Operations**: Perform various operations on objects, such as counting, computing statistics, etc.
- **Update**: Update attributes of an object.
- **Destroy**: Delete an object.

## Resources

To successfully complete this project, the following resources will be helpful:

- [cmd module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html)
- [cmd module in depth](https://pymotw.com/3/cmd/)
- [Python packages concept page](https://packaging.python.org/overview/)
- [uuid module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html)
- [datetime module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
- [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [args/kwargs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments)

- [python unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

## Learning Objectives

By working on this project, you will gain knowledge and skills in the following areas:

- Creating a Python package
- Implementing a command interpreter using the cmd module
- Understanding and implementing unit testing in a large project
- Serializing and deserializing a class object
- Reading and writing JSON files
- Managing datetime in Python
- Working with UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers)
- Understanding and utilizing *args and **kwargs in functions
- Handling named arguments in functions

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain these concepts to others and demonstrate proficiency in their practical application.

Best of luck with the AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter project! Enjoy building your first full web application.
